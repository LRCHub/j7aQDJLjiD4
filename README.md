[00:19.23] I'm gonna make you bend and break (it sent you to me without wings)
[00:53.41] Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
[00:56.98] In case God doesn't show
[01:00.35] (Let the good times roll)
[01:01.12] (Let the good times roll)
[01:13.62] 
[01:02.50] And I want these words to make things right
[01:05.25] But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
[01:09.22] "Who does he think he is?"
[01:11.37] If that's the worst you've got
[01:12.91] Better put your fingers back to the keys
[01:32.91] 
[01:15.06] One night and one more time
[01:18.09] Thanks for the memories
[01:19.70] Even though they weren't so great
[01:21.47] "He tastes like you only sweeter"
[01:27.00] One night, yeah, and one more time
[01:30.23] Thanks for the memories
[01:31.82] Thanks for the memories
[01:33.41] "See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
[01:52.41] 
[01:46.29] I'm looking forward to the future
[01:49.41] But my eyesight is going bad
[01:52.66] And this crystal ball
[01:58.05] It's always cloudy except for (except for)
[02:01.25] When you look into the past (look into the past)
[02:04.95] One night stand (one night stand off)
[02:23.45] 
[02:10.88] One night and one more time
[02:13.72] Thanks for the memories
[02:15.32] Even though they weren't so great
[02:17.23] "He tastes like you only sweeter"
[02:22.88] One night, yeah, and one more time
[02:26.03] Thanks for the memories
[02:27.91] Thanks for the memories
[02:29.53] "See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
[02:48.53] 
[02:35.64] (They say) I only think in the form of crunching numbers
[02:42.19] In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
[02:48.27] Get me out of my mind, and get you out of those clothes
[02:54.65] I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa
[03:21.15] 
[03:01.90] One night and one more time
[03:05.04] Thanks for the memories
[03:06.68] Even though they weren't so great
[03:09.07] "He tastes like you only sweeter"
[03:14.15] One night, yeah, and one more time
[03:17.33] Thanks for the memories
[03:18.95] Thanks for the memories
[03:20.54] "See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
[03:39.54] 
[03:26.61] One night and one more time (one more night, one more time)
[03:30.46] Thanks for the memories
[03:31.48] Even though they weren't so great
[03:33.02] "He tastes like you only sweeter"
[03:39.28] One night, yeah, and one more time (one more night, one more time)
[03:42.15] Thanks for the memories (for the memories)
[03:44.01] Thanks for the memories (for the memories)
[03:49.93] "See, he tastes like you only sweeter"
